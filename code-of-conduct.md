## Code of Conduct
If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of conference staff immediately. Organisers and helpers can be identified by t-shirts.

Harassment includes, but is not limited to, offensive verbal comments, deliberate intimidation, disruption of talks, and unwelcome or inappropriate attention and contact.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to comply immediately. Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy.

If a participant engages in harassing behaviour, the organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the unconference.

We will be happy to help participants contact venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the event. We value your attendance.

We expect participants to follow these rules at conference and workshop venues and unconference-related social events.
