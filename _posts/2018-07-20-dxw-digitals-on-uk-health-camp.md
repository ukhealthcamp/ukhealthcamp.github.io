[UK Health Camp](/) is back for its third year, and this year it’s taking place in Manchester on Saturday 8th September.

The reasoning behind this is to encourage a more diverse range of attendees and to capture the full range of excellent healthcare initiatives happening around the country.

### About UK Health Camp

The healthcare sector faces unique challenges in the implementation of technology. Procurement frameworks tend to favour larger organisations at the expense of smaller, more innovative companies and the pace of change is slow. This was acknowledged with the publication of the Accelerated Access Review last October which addressed these issues. It called for a more innovative culture in the NHS and a broader remit for the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). Meanwhile, public confidence has been shaken by a series of high-profile project failures.

The aim of [UK Health Camp](/) unconference is to make both health and care services better for everyone involved – patients, carers and health professionals across the board and we’re very pleased to be this year’s Gold evening sponsors.

### Sponsoring UK Health Camp

At dxw digital, improving innovation in healthcare in the UK is a subject close to our hearts, having worked with [The Department of Health & Social Care](https://www.dxw.com/case-studies/department-of-health-intranet/), [NHS England](https://www.dxw.com/2017/06/its-london-tech-week-take-a-look-at-how-weve-been-improving-the-nhs-england-site/) and on [NHS Jobs](https://www.dxw.com/case-studies/nhs-jobs/) so we’re thrilled to be sponsoring UK Health Camp this year.

The fact that UK Health Camp 2018 is being held in the north of the country is another reason we were keen to be sponsors, as we’re [opening our first ‘out-of-London’ office later this year in Leeds](https://www.dxw.com/2018/07/dxw-digital-in-leeds/), enabling us to introduce more diversity to our team and bring in different experiences from having a team drawn entirely from London and the South East.

### About dxw digital

We believe that it is possible for the public sector to become something recognisably better and we’re on a mission to make that happen! Our vision is not just to make ‘nicer websites’, but to help public sector teams make better decisions about technology and build better services.  By bringing together policy and delivery, and embedding agile principles into teams, we’ve been able to help clients save time and money and ensure they are primarily thinking in terms of user needs.

We’re looking forward to hearing some great pitches and opening up new conversations about innovation in the health sector this weekend – and of course, meeting some great people!
