### Hi {{ first_name }},

We are really excited about UK Health Camp 2019 on **Saturday 14th of September** at the **Office for National Statistics in Newport, Wales**!

The **final** batch of tickets is going to be released on **August the 7th** and we want to offer as many as possible.

If you **can no longer make it** that's no problem but help us _give someone else the chance to attend_ - **please cancel your ticket** using the link at the bottom of this email (click on "View Ticket", then click the "Cancel this ticket" button), or by dropping us a quick email to <us@ukhealthcamp.com>.

### Sponsorship

We rely on sponsorship to make UK Health Camp happen, everything from the venue to lunch is paid for by sponsors. If we raise enough money we may also be able to fund bursaries for travel and/or childcare to ensure everyone can attend.

If you are in a position to sponsor us or know someone/an organisation that would be interested email <sponsors@ukhealthcamp.com> and check out our [sponsorship packages](https://ukhealthcamp.com/sponsorship).
