### Planning your travel - Engineering Work & Disruption

If traveling by **train** üöÜ we have been made aware that _Great Western Railway_ have **Planned Engineering Work and Disruption** for the weekend of the conference ‚òπÔ∏èüöÇ.

Details are available on their website [here](https://www.gwr.com/travel-updates/planned-engineering) but it looks like there will be bus replacement services operating with an altered timetable hopefully this won't disrupt your travel too much.
