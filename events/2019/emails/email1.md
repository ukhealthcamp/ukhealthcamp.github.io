### Hi {{ first_name }},

There are just a few weeks until _UK Health Camp 2019_ on **Saturday 14th of September** at the **[Office for National Statistics](https://www.ons.gov.uk/), [Government Buildings, Cardiff Road, Newport NP10 8XG](https://goo.gl/maps/Xb4gZ3ntw3xe2sUP9)**. We wanted to give you some more information and ask you to let us know if you can no longer attend, and if you would like to use free transport in Newport or parking at the ONS which we have arranged.

### We have a waitlist - let us know if you can't make it

If you **can no longer make it** that's no problem but help us _give someone else the chance to attend_ - **please cancel your ticket** üéüÔ∏è using the link at the bottom of this email (click on "View Ticket", then click the "Cancel this ticket" button), or by dropping us a quick email to <us@ukhealthcamp.com>.

### Planning your travel

If you are travelling by **train** to Newport üöÜ you can use a free bus shuttle service from _Newport_ station to the ONS operating from 0830 &ndash; 1030 with a return service aiming to arrive back at the station by ~1730. If you would like to use this service please [reserve a place on the shuttles](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeicnBzEtcgLWYWMAN-dDOIZTtVTEjcpR7NMNoGmeDhxRtKVQ/viewform?usp=pp_url&entry.1086889808={{ recipient_email }}&entry.240437001=I+would+like+to+reserve+a+place+on+the+shuttles+to+and+from+Newport+train+station).

**Car parking** is available for free on the ONS site. However you **will be refused access** unless you have [registered for parking](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeicnBzEtcgLWYWMAN-dDOIZTtVTEjcpR7NMNoGmeDhxRtKVQ/viewform?usp=pp_url&entry.1086889808={{ recipient_email }}&entry.240437001=I+would+like+to+register+for+parking+at+the+ONS+site&entry.2119060234={{ first_name }} {{ last_name }}) by providing your _name_ and _car registration_ in advance.

### In the evening

From 17:00 onwards, we will move to _**[Tiny Rebel](https://www.tinyrebel.co.uk/bars/newport-centre/), [22 High St, Newport NP20 1FX](https://goo.gl/maps/c3f8KWD3za52eoA19)**_.

Come along to continue the conversation into the evening, or just to relax with friends! Don‚Äôt worry about knowing your way around, **if you have [reserved a place](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeicnBzEtcgLWYWMAN-dDOIZTtVTEjcpR7NMNoGmeDhxRtKVQ/viewform?usp=pp_url&entry.1086889808={{ recipient_email }}&entry.240437001=I+would+like+to+reserve+a+place+on+the+shuttles+to+and+from+Newport+train+station) on the bus shuttle service** camp makers will be navigating attendees along the 5-minute walk from the drop off point at the station to the pub.

Please [let us know](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeicnBzEtcgLWYWMAN-dDOIZTtVTEjcpR7NMNoGmeDhxRtKVQ/viewform?usp=pp_url&entry.1086889808={{ recipient_email }}) if you are going to join us so that we make sure we have enough food. 

### Camp Makers

UK Health Camp is completely **run by volunteers** and relies on the support of people like you to enable the event to take place. Being a camp maker is a great **opportunity to contribute** to the event and your community, and typically only requires you to dedicate a small amount of time on the day. 

The **average volunteer helps with 2 or 3 things** like taking people‚Äôs coats or tidying up at the end of the day. We endeavour to ensure that no-one who volunteers misses more one or two of the sessions at most. If you‚Äôd like to help us out please register to be a [Camp Maker](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeicnBzEtcgLWYWMAN-dDOIZTtVTEjcpR7NMNoGmeDhxRtKVQ/viewform?usp=pp_url&entry.1086889808={{ recipient_email }}&entry.308702425=Yes).
