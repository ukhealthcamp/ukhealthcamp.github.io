## Refreshments

There will be a free staffed coffee bar for Barista made hot drinks. Water will be available throughout the event.

_The coffee bar is operated by [Coffee Geek and Friends](http://www.coffeegeekandfriends.co.uk/)._

**For more information on available refreshments see our [catering page](/events/2022/menu).**

## Lunch

Lunch is free to all ticket-holders, and is being provided by [Route Catering](https://routecatering.co.uk/). 

**You can view our lunch menu on the [catering page](/events/2022/menu).**

## Camp makers

Volunteer camp makers will be helping to ensure the day runs smoothly - you will be able to identify camp makers by their red "Organiser" or "Camp maker" badges.

**Feel free to ask camp makers for help or information** - if they can't help you they will find someone who can!


## Pitching and planning

If you've never been to an [unconference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference), **Don't Panic**.

Instead of a schedule arranged ahead of time featuring presentations and panels brought to you by the great and the good, **everyone in the room gets to help design the agenda for the day** as the first order of business.

We invite all attendees to propose ideas and topics that they would like to discuss, then with a brief flurry of concentration, post-its and pragmatism we arrange these into a [session grid](/session-grid/#/2019) (schedule). 

**Have a look at our dedicated page on [Pitching and Leading a Session](/pitching) for an explanation of how this works and what help is available.**

### Examples of previous sessions

To give you a taste of the kinds of things that come up, you can **see the [session grids](/session-grid/#/2019) from past UK Health Camps** or a [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oIRrU1rWakVxObhuYJhFNwe_BuKnkAtd1R_olz_Q040) of all the past sessions.


## Accessibility

The events space we are using within the [Accurx Offices](https://www.accurx.com/) is accessible including accessible toilets.

There is a dedicated prayer / meditation / quiet room available for attendees to use throughout the day.

If you have any specific requirements please contact us: <us@ukhealthcamp.com>.

## Code of Conduct

We have a [Code of Conduct](https://ukhealthcamp.com/code-of-conduct) and ask for cooperation from all participants to help ensure a safe environment for everybody at UK Health Camp.

If you have any concerns throughout the day, please find a member of the UK Health Camp team who will help you.

## COVID-19 / Masks

Inline with UK Government guidance there are currently no requirements for an explicit COVID-19 risk assessment for an event. Government restrictions including mandatory COVID-19 status checking to enter venues have also been lifted.

However we expect attendees to act in a sensible and responsible manner and not attend if they are unwell, symptomatic or testing positive for COVID-19. We also expect - inline with our [Code of Conduct](https://ukhealthcamp.com/code-of-conduct) - attendees to respect the choice of those who chose to take precautions to manage their risk during the event (e.g by wearing a mask).

### Masks

As noted above inline with current UK Government guidance there is no requirement for mask wearing during UK Health Camp 2022. However we expect attendees to respect the choice of others to either wear a mask or not.

## Crèche / Childcare

When registering for a ticket you may have noticed the question:

> "Would you use a free onsite crèche/childcare **if available**?"

Unfortunately, we are not going to be able to provide a crèche/childcare this year. We appreciate this may have an impact on those with caring responsibilities who would like to attend. 

If this affects you and your ability to attend please email <us@ukhealthcamp.com>

## Dress Code

There is no specific dress code for UK Health Camp. Please wear whatever you feel comfortable in. Usually most attendees are in informal or casual wear.

You can view pictures taken by [Paul Clarke](http://paulclarke.com/) of UK Health Camp 2015 [here](https://www.flickr.com/photos/paul_clarke/albums/72157661704564366) for more detail.

## Photography

There will be an event photographer taking photos primarily for future publication and promotion of UK Health Camp. Other attendees may also be taking photographs. 

If you **do not wish to be photographed** please let us know at registration and we will give you a **yellow lanyard**. 

As per our [Code of Conduct](https://ukhealthcamp.com/code-of-conduct) we ask other attendees taking photographs during the event to also respect this choice.
