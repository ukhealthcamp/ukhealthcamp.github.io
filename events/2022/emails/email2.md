### Hi {{ first_name }},

There are just under _two weeks_ until _UK Health Camp 2022_ on **Saturday 15th of October** in the **[Accurx Offices](https://www.accurx.com/), [7 Curtain Rd, London EC2A 3LT](https://goo.gl/maps/5cqvtcwAL1LJ1zPN6)** and are really excited!

### Can't make it? Let us know - we have a waiting list!

If you **can no longer make it** that's no problem but help us _give someone else the chance to attend_ - **please cancel your ticket** üéüÔ∏è using the link at the bottom of this email (click on "View Ticket", then click the "Cancel this ticket" button), or by dropping us a quick email to <us@ukhealthcamp.com>.

### Code of Conduct

Please do take a couple of minutes to familiarise yourself with our üìú[code of conduct](https://ukhealthcamp.com/code-of-conduct). We do expect all attendees to follow the code of conduct to ensure that the event is welcoming and safe for everyone who attends.

### Start the conversation early on Slack

Did you know we have a UK Health Camp Slack community? Come and say hi! üëã by joining our Slack community here: <https://ukhealthcamp.com/join-slack> 

_Slack is a professional chat tool for bringing remote communities together - you can find out more at <https://slack.com/>_

### Volunteer as a Camp Makers

We still need some more Camp Makers to help things run smoothly on the day. UK Health Camp is completely **run by volunteers** and relies on the support of people like you to enable the event to take place. If you‚Äôd like to help us out please sign-up to be a Camp Maker [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfgY5MbCPgfCC4ex10zw0d4SBZtRGSr_ET3Zgb1IN4bbO5QnQ/viewform?usp=pp_url&entry.681806428={{ recipient_email }}).

The **average volunteer helps with 2 or 3 things** like taking people‚Äôs coats, taking session notes or tidying up at the end of the day. It typically only requires you to dedicate a small amount of time on the day. We try to ensure that no-one who volunteers misses more than one or two of the sessions. 

### More event information

We've gathered together lots of useful information onto a single üîó[2022 event page](https://ukhealthcamp.com/events/2022) so check it out for more details. We will keep updating this over the next few weeks.

_If you think there's something missing, let us know! <us@ukhealthcamp.com>_

### Thanks to our supporters

We couldn't put on UK Health Camp without the support of our sponsors. We rely on sponsorship to make it all happen, everything from the venue to lunch is paid for by sponsors.
