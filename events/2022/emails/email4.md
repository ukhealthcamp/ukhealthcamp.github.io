### Hi {{ first_name }},

**This Saturday (15th of October)** is _UK Health Camp 2022_ at the **[Accurx Offices](https://www.accurx.com/), [7 Curtain Rd, London EC2A 3LT](https://goo.gl/maps/5cqvtcwAL1LJ1zPN6)** and we can't wait to meet you!

### Take a look the lunch menu

Check out the [menu](https://ukhealthcamp.com/events/2022/menu) for detail on what free 🥣food and ☕refreshments we'll be providing on the day. 

_[Let us know](mailto:us@ukhealthcamp.com) if you have any specific **dietary requirements** that are **not being met** and need us to provide anything else._

### First Unconference?

If you've never been to an [unconference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference) before **Don't Panic**.

Instead of a schedule **everyone in the room gets to help design the agenda for the day** as the first order of business.

Have a look at our **dedicated page on [Pitching and Leading a Session](https://ukhealthcamp.com/pitching)** for an explanation of how this works and what help is available.

### More event information

We've gathered together lots of useful information onto a single 🔗[2022 event page](https://ukhealthcamp.com/events/2022) so check it out for details on things like: the agenda, the free 🥣lunch and ☕refreshments, our 📜[code of conduct](https://ukhealthcamp.com/code-of-conduct) and much more.

### Plans changed? Can't make it? Let us know - we have a waiting list!

If you **can no longer make it** help us _give someone else the chance to attend_ - **please cancel your ticket** 🎟️ using the link at the bottom of this email (click on "View Ticket", then click the "Cancel this ticket" button), or by dropping us a quick email to <us@ukhealthcamp.com>.
