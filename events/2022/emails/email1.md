### Hi {{ first_name }},

There are _a few weeks_ until _UK Health Camp 2022_ on **Saturday 15th of October** in **Shoreditch, London (Hosted by Accurx)** and we can't wait!

### Volunteer as a Camp Makers

We still need some more Camp Makers to help things run smoothly on the day. UK Health Camp is completely **run by volunteers** and relies on the support of people like you to enable the event to take place. If you‚Äôd like to help us out please sign-up to be a Camp Maker [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfgY5MbCPgfCC4ex10zw0d4SBZtRGSr_ET3Zgb1IN4bbO5QnQ/viewform?usp=pp_url&entry.681806428={{ recipient_email }}).

The **average volunteer helps with 2 or 3 things** like taking people‚Äôs coats, taking session notes or tidying up at the end of the day. It typically only requires you to dedicate a small amount of time on the day. We try to ensure that no-one who volunteers misses more than one or two of the sessions. 

### First Unconference?

If you've never been to an [unconference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference) before **Don't Panic**.

Instead of a schedule arranged ahead of time featuring presentations and panels brought to you by the great and the good, **everyone in the room gets to help design the agenda for the day** as the first order of business.

We invite all attendees to propose ideas and topics that they would like to discuss, then with a brief flurry of concentration, post-its and pragmatism we arrange these into a schedule ([session grid](https://ukhealthcamp.com/session-grid/#/2019)). For inspiration you can **see the [session grids](https://ukhealthcamp.com/session-grid/#/2019) from past UK Health Camps** or a [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oIRrU1rWakVxObhuYJhFNwe_BuKnkAtd1R_olz_Q040) of all the past sessions.

_For more detail and tips on the process check out the [pitching and planning](https://ukhealthcamp.com/events/2022/#pitching-and-planning) section on the [event page](https://ukhealthcamp.com/events/2022)._
