### More event information

We've gathered together lots of useful information onto a single 🔗[2022 event page](https://ukhealthcamp.com/events/2022) so check it out for details on things like: the agenda, the free 🥣lunch and ☕refreshments, our 📜[code of conduct](https://ukhealthcamp.com/code-of-conduct) and much more.


### First Unconference?

If you've never been to an [unconference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference) before **Don't Panic**.

Instead of a schedule **everyone in the room gets to help design the agenda for the day** as the first order of business.

Have a look at our **dedicated page on [Pitching and Leading a Session](https://ukhealthcamp.com/pitching)** for an explanation of how this works and what help is available.

### Code of Conduct

Please do take a couple of minutes to familiarise yourself with our 📜[code of conduct](https://ukhealthcamp.com/code-of-conduct). We do expect all attendees to follow the code of conduct to ensure that the event is welcoming and safe for everyone who attends.

**See you Tomorrow!**
