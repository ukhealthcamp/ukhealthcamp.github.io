### Hi {{ first_name }},

We are really excited about UK Health Camp 2022 on **Saturday 15th of October** in **Shoreditch, London (Hosted by Accurx)**.

Another batch of tickets is going to be released on **September the 21st** and we want to offer as many as possible.

If you **can no longer make it** that's no problem but help us _give someone else the chance to attend_ - **please cancel your ticket** using the link at the bottom of this email (click on "View Ticket", then click the "Cancel this ticket" button), or by dropping us a quick email to <us@ukhealthcamp.com>.

### Volunteer as a Camp Makers

UK Health Camp is completely **run by volunteers** and relies on the support of people like you to enable the event to take place. Being a camp maker is a great **opportunity to contribute** to the event and your community, and typically only requires you to dedicate a small amount of time on the day. 

The **average volunteer helps with 2 or 3 things** like taking people’s coats, taking session notes or tidying up at the end of the day. We try to ensure that no-one who volunteers misses more than one or two of the sessions. If you’d like to help us out please sign-up to be a Camp Maker [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfgY5MbCPgfCC4ex10zw0d4SBZtRGSr_ET3Zgb1IN4bbO5QnQ/viewform?usp=pp_url&entry.681806428={{ recipient_email }}).


### Sponsorship

We rely on sponsorship to make UK Health Camp happen, everything from the venue to lunch is paid for by sponsors. We’re still looking for support from sponsors to help us run UK Health Camp 2022.

If you are in a position to sponsor us or know someone/an organisation that would be interested email <sponsors@ukhealthcamp.com> and check out our [sponsorship packages](https://ukhealthcamp.com/sponsorship).
