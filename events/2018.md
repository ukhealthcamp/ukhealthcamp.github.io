From 17:00 onwards, we will move to the nearby _**[Abel Heywood Pub](https://abelheywood.co.uk/), [38 Turner Street, Manchester M4 1DZ](https://goo.gl/maps/UnZdLt8tygu)**_.

Come along to **continue the conversation** into the evening, or just to relax with friends! Don't worry about knowing your way around, **camp makers will be navigating attendees** along the 6-minute walk to the pub.

_[dxw digital](https://www.dxw.com/) have kindly sponsored drinks and nibbles._

## Camp makers

Volunteer camp makers will be helping to ensure the day runs smoothly - you will be able to identify camp makers by their red "Organiser" or "Camp maker" badges.

**Feel free to ask camp makers for help or information** - if they can't help you they will find someone who can!

## Pitching and planning

If you've never been to an [unconference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference), **Don't Panic**.

Instead of a schedule arranged ahead of time featuring presentations and panels brought to you by the great and the good, **everyone in the room gets to help design the agenda for the day** as the first order of business.

We invite all attendees to propose ideas and topics that they would like to discuss, then with a brief flurry of concentration, post-its and pragmatism we arrange these into a [session grid](https://twitter.com/puntofisso/status/914074219998269440) (schedule). 


**Sessions should bias strongly towards being discursive** rather than a talk from a single person. Think seminar rather than lecture, more socratic than didactic.

This way, we turn the conversations that happen in the hallway, in between sessions at most conferences, into the main event. You'll grow your network with passionate and clueful people, and get to jump in and join the party.

_If you have an idea for a session, but are **not too comfortable with the pitching process**, come and **find a camp maker or drop us a line** at <us@ukhealthcamp.com>. We'll happily find someone who will support you making a pitch, or who could make the pitch on your behalf._

If you have any concerns throughout the day, please find a member of the UK Health Camp team who will help you.

## Photography

There will be an event photographer taking photos primarily for future publication and promotion of UK Health Camp. Other attendees may also be taking photographs. 

If you **do not wish to be photographed** please let us know at registration and we will give you a **yellow lanyard**. 

As per our [Code of Conduct](https://ukhealthcamp.com/code-of-conduct) we ask other attendees taking photographs during the event to also respect this choice.

## Cloakroom

We are planning to run a small cloakroom (free) which will either be staffed or locked when not staffed. 

If you need something from the cloakroom when it is locked, just find an organiser or camp maker and they'll help you out.
