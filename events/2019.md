Come along to continue the conversation into the evening, or just to relax with friends! Don’t worry about knowing your way around, **if you have [reserved a place](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeicnBzEtcgLWYWMAN-dDOIZTtVTEjcpR7NMNoGmeDhxRtKVQ/viewform?usp=pp_url&entry.240437001=I+would+like+to+reserve+a+place+on+the+shuttles+to+and+from+Newport+train+station) on the bus shuttle service** camp makers will be navigating attendees along the 5-minute walk from the drop off point at the station to the pub.

_[dxw digital](https://www.dxw.com/) have kindly sponsored drinks and nibbles._

## Lunch

Lunch is free to all ticket-holders, and is being provided by Baxterstorey.

**You can view our lunch menu on the [lunch menu page](/events/2019-menu).**


## Camp makers

Volunteer camp makers will be helping to ensure the day runs smoothly - you will be able to identify camp makers by their red "Organiser" or "Camp maker" badges.

**Feel free to ask camp makers for help or information** - if they can't help you they will find someone who can!

_UK Health Camp is completely **run by volunteers** and relies on support of people like you to enable the event to take place. If you’d like to help us out please register to be a [Camp Maker](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeicnBzEtcgLWYWMAN-dDOIZTtVTEjcpR7NMNoGmeDhxRtKVQ/viewform?usp=pp_url&entry.308702425=Yes)._

## Pitching and planning

If you've never been to an [unconference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference), **Don't Panic**.

Instead of a schedule arranged ahead of time featuring presentations and panels brought to you by the great and the good, **everyone in the room gets to help design the agenda for the day** as the first order of business.

We invite all attendees to propose ideas and topics that they would like to discuss, then with a brief flurry of concentration, post-its and pragmatism we arrange these into a [session grid](https://twitter.com/puntofisso/status/914074219998269440) (schedule). 


**Sessions should bias strongly towards being discursive** rather than a talk from a single person. Think seminar rather than lecture, more socratic than didactic.

This way, we turn the conversations that happen in the hallway, in between sessions at most conferences, into the main event. You'll grow your network with passionate and clueful people, and get to jump in and join the party.

_If you have an idea for a session, but are **not too comfortable with the pitching process**, come and **find a camp maker or drop us a line** at <us@ukhealthcamp.com>. We'll happily find someone who will support you making a pitch, or who could make the pitch on your behalf._
