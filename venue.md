## Can you help us with a venue to host UK Health Camp? 

UK Health Camp is the free unconference for people interested in digital, design, technology and data for health and care.

Finding a suitable and empathetic venue is the hardest first step of getting the show on the road! 

We love partnering with organisations who are keen to reflect the diversity of digital in the health and care ecosystem and the spirit of open and honest conversation!

### Please get in touch!

<us@ukhealthcamp.com> / ukhealthcamp.com

### Networking and visibility

This is your chance to be a primary named supporter of the event, and have 100+ highly committed health and care specialists introduced to your organisation.

### What we need in a venue

Through running several of these events previously, we know that we need to meet certain venue criteria in order to make an event really successful:

- Plenary space for 100-120 people

- At least 5 breakout rooms, plus a quiet room and cloakroom

- Space for lunch, refreshments and sponsor stands

- Step-free access and accessible facilities throughout

- Wi-Fi, PA system and projector in plenary area

- Venue access from 08:00 to 18:00 for setup and teardown

- Permission to bring in catering (or high quality in-house options)

- Good public transport links (or shuttle options)

*Bonus points for:* storage the day before and after the event, and a day-to-day facilities contact for logistics.

🏛️ Well-suited hosts might include NHS delivery partners, universities, public bodies, SMEs working in the health and care space, mission-aligned coworking spaces etc.

We’ll need someone with authority to sign off venue use and a facilities contact to help with practicalities.
