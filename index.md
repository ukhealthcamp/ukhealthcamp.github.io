## What is UK Health Camp?
There’s lots of brilliant things happening to make health and care services better for patients, carers and professionals.

**Our aim is to provide a space to connect, share ideas and make things happen.**

This isn't the first HealthCamp - [similar events](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HealthCamp) have been held in other countries and in the UK in 2015 and 2017.

**We are open to all**, whether you work for the NHS or not.

Our events are multidisciplinary - we aim to bring together health and care professionals, policy makers and service managers together with designers, digital specialists and technologists. Everyone is welcome.

We believe that diversity at conferences and events is important and support the **[Diversity Charter](https://diversitycharter.org/)**.  

[![Diversity Charter](images/diversitycharter_small.png){:width="150" class="sponsor"}](https://diversitycharter.org/)  

**We have a [Code of Conduct](/code-of-conduct)** and ask for cooperation from all participants to help ensure a safe environment for everybody at UK Health Camp.

## How does it work?
UK Health Camp isn’t a healthcare IT conference. It is:

- Free to attend
- Free from keynotes and sponsor pitches
- Designed by its participants: everyone attending can pitch a topic or actively take part in sessions
- Based on the [Open Space principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Space_Technology) like our sister [BarCamp](http://barcamp.org)-style events [UKGovcamp](http://www.ukgovcamp.com) and [LocalGovCamp](http://localgovdigital.info/localgovcamp/)
